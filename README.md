<b>This is a collection, it's not organized. It's not a collection of the *best* versions, every single one is being archived.  
It's simply a collection of *every* njrat version ever made, any version with *backdoors*, I will add info.  
If I can *clean* the backdoor or remove it, I will do so. Otherwise i've written info about the backdoor.  
I will add anything based on the released/decompiled njRAT/njRDP/njWorm source codes.  
This is for *archival* purposes only, I am not responsible for *any* of your usage or any problems that you will run into.

Unarchived: ARES RAT  
Reason: Unnecessarily large WAV file in resources taking up 48+ MB of space.  
Cannot be uploaded because of the filesize.  

Unarchived: njRAT 0.7d Green Edition (RUS)  
Reason: Instantly drops a backdoor when launched to owners PC.  
If I clean this I will upload it, else, no..
